# ms-comp-challenge-2

For this project, I chose to focus on destinations that people might want to share. For the layout, I wanted to maintain the card size without any shrinking at all - from large screens to mobile, the card stays the same size. To do it, I automatically re-centered the layout every time the screen came to a breaking poing. Since I wanted everything to stay the same height/width/size I used very few percentages in the CSS. I also cropped the photos to my specifications and shrunk their pixels per inch so they would be the exact size I needed and not take up any additional space.
